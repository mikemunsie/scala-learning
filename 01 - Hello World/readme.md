Notes: (day of learning all over again lol)

- val stands for immutable
- var allows you to change the property after it's been created
- Basic types: Int, Double, Byte, Char, Short, Long, Flat, Boolean
- Semicolons are optional (most devs do not use semicolons)
- Use val whenever you can
- Everything is an object
- ++ and -- are not in Scala. You must use += or -=
- only use parenthesis on mutators
- You can use _ while in a map to get the current item in the array
- When you use an import statement, the code after the import will get to use what you are importing
